Testing Infrastructure Bot 

Student: Abshir Edow
Project: Testing Infrastructure Bot
Focus: QA Automation & Infrastructure Engineering

Project Overview

The Testing Infrastructure Bot is a multi-week engineering project designed to build a realistic QA automation platform. The goal of the system is to automatically:

Understand different types of users (personas)

Convert their interactions into structured QA test cases

Store those test cases in a scalable way

Later execute them with automated testing tools

This project mirrors how modern software engineering teams build intelligent QA systems that combine AI, automation, and reliable test infrastructure.

Personas & User Flows

Personas were created to represent different real-world users interacting with a system. Each persona includes:

Who the user is

What they’re trying to do

How they move through the system

These personas and flows are the foundation for generating meaningful QA test cases.

AI-Powered Test Case Generation

The system uses:

Node.js

LangChain

Groq AI (Llama 3)

Structured JSON enforcement

When a persona and scenario are provided, the AI:

Thinks like a QA engineer

Writes a structured test case

Includes:

Test ID

Persona

Description

Preconditions

Detailed test steps

Expected results

Timestamp

Metadata

This allows scalable, repeatable, high-quality test creation without manually writing everything.
